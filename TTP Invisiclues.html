Each question should hopefully correspond to a problem you might be facing or a puzzle you might need help with in your playthrough. Click on each triangle in order to get a (hopefully) increasingly specific series of hints about the problem or puzzle. Try it below.<br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Like this.</details><br>

<b>Where does this title fall on the scale of cruelty?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Somewhere between Merciful and Polite. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Fatal actions *should* generally be prompt and clearly signaled.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>There should be no unwinnable situations; that said, keep a save or two, since the function of the automatic rewind cannot be guaranteed in all cases.</details><br>

<h3><b>Berlin</b></h3><br>

<b>I can't go north!</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Lots of debris about, isn't there.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>But not so much as to be impossible to traverse.
</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You can MOVE PLANKS to get to the door.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Once you've done that, simply KNOCK.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Yikes!</details><br>

<b>I keep dying!</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Well, hide!</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Seems you did already.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>That machinery wasn't obvious before, what might you have done if you'd seen it?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Take a good look.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Try throwing the disc at the drone.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>You're on the right track, at least.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Note the description of the drone.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>And the fact that the rain is mentioned constantly.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>The curtains aren't doing a very good job, but maybe they could be doing a worse one.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>Throw the disc at the curtains.</details><br>

<b>Who is Lev Nomov?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You'll find out.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Hey, nobody ever said you'd find out *everything*.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>For now, like you're told, the only way out is through.</details><br>

<b>What do I do now?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You've talked to Nomov, right?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Try playing around with the objects.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Or picking one up for a better look.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Woops!</details><br>

<b>What do I do with the gnomon?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It's very helpful once you get back outside.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You'll know when to use it.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Or, you would, if there *was* one in this game.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Have you looked at the boxed something, by the way?</details><br>

<b>Does it matter which object I choose?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Try it out. Save first.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Examine your inventory carefully, wherever you land.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You've still got whichever item you took.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Try dropping it.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Try taking it from the table again.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>No guarantees, but it should be *very* difficult to get yourself stuck this way, so experiment to your heart's content.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Serious potential spoilers ahead.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>It also isn't necessary to move any items between worlds to see the ending, or to solve puzzles in one world to unlock something in another.</details><br>

<b>Where am I?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>In a castle.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You've read the sign, yes?</details><br>

<b>What's going on?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>That's a better question.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You're somewhere else.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Probably somewhen else.</details><br>

<b>What's up with the stairs?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>A bit of experimentation should give you some clues.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Everything's very... musical here, isn't it?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>X STEPS</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>You can refer to each step with PRESS THREE and such.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>But it'll be easier to use SEQ to play some number in order; the game will give you this hint after a few tries.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>It'll also tell you that you're looking for an eight-digit sequence.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Where else can you find a sequence of eight things?</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>You're looking for the embroidery on the sideboard - give it a look.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Something's a bit stilted about that writing.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>It's the first letters of each line - lots of Es.</details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>Actually, it's all A through G.</details>
<details><summary>12.</summary>Eight lines, nine notes.</details>
<details><summary>13.</summary>See below if this still gives you trouble.</details>
<details><summary>14.</summary>The second line doesn't have a word missing - note the capital E. It's actually giving you a hint that this E is different somehow.</details>
<details><summary>15.</summary>It corresponds to 8 and not 1.</details>

<b>Is the jigsaw puzzle important?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>This story is consistent and 'friendly' about signalling when objects are important.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>The jigsaw puzzle is described on a separate line of the Dining Hall.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Ergo, it is important.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Spoilers below.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Your goal in the castle is to solve the jigsaw puzzle by finding the three missing pieces.</details><br>

<b>What do I do with the jigsaw puzzle?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You could finish it, solving puzzles tends to mean progress after all.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Missing pieces? I guess quality control isn't what it used to be.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Awfully strange shapes, too.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Considering that everything around here seems to be musically-themed...</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You'll find the pieces soon enough, if you poke around the right places.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Once you do, the purpose of the puzzle should become clear. See the last question in this section.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Only read the below if you're well and truly lost.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>One piece is found by solving the stairs puzzle explained in the previous question.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>One piece is obtained from the squirrel outside.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>One piece is obtained by using the punched card from the strange device with the organ in the Blood Room.</details><br>

<b>Do I need to leave the castle?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Not unless you want to solve the puzzles inside it.</details><br>

<b>That's me!</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Relax, it's just *a* Gromov, not *you*, Gromov.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>What would *you* do in this situation?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>He's harmless, albeit very much harmed.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Have a chat with him.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>And hope you manage to avoid his fate.</details><br>

<b>What's the deal with the fresco? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Five lines, nine levels.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>What else has five lines?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>There's music everywhere here.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Musical scales have five lines.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>See the question about the stairs.</details><br>

<b>What am I doing in the grounds?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You need to find several useful things out here.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Explore thoroughly, make a note of anything unusual you spot.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The squirrel has something.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Gromov drops something for you, too.</details><br>

<b>How do I get what the squirrel has? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Just go up and take it.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>That cat's a nuisance, isn't it?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Maybe you can give the feline something else to worry about. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>The statue will help you distract it. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Once you've dealt with the cat, you can approach the squirrel closer. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>It still doesn't trust you, so- what's the universal language of animals? </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Food. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Give it another apple. </details><br>

<b>What do I do with the statue?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Her hand is extended 'as if to hold a serving dish'. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Look in the kitchen.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>No kitchen? Well, maybe she'll hold something else. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>You make a good point to yourself - you wouldn't want to lose something important in the water. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Find something unimportant. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>An apple. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Now the cat won't be a problem. </details><br>

<b>How do I open the door in Grand Living?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Examine furiously. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Specifically, look at the figures. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Each seems to be missing something. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>The sword, you'll get from Gromov. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>The flag, you'll find in the couch. </details><br>

<b>What does the stain mean?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Has anything good ever come of investigating a bloodstain? </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Yes, actually. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You'll be in there soon enough, if you poke around. </details><br>

<b>What do I do with the armor?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It's a good spot to hide when they come looking for you.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Remember to use the anchovy oil on it. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>But they won't, so it's not, and don't. </details><br>

<b>What's the fireplace good for? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It's not really cold enough for a fire right now, is it? </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Someone else thought differently. Get a good look at the embers. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You want that pin. Use the poker to move it.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>The decor around the fireplace also gets a lot of attention - try taking a closer look. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You've got a peg and a square hole. Do the math. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>You may need a hammer to get it all the way in. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Or something else long and heavy. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>It's already in your hand. </details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>PUSH PIN WITH POKER</details><br>

<b>What do I do in the Blood Room?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Count your lucky stars that you’re not Gromov. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Remember that you are.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Better not spend too long here.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>But the diary is worth reading.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>The organ is also relevant - remember looking at the puzzle?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>How do you play a player piano?</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>See the question about the strange device in the Northwest room.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Once you have the punched card, just put it in the organ and wait.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>You’ll need that.</details><br>

<b>How do I get the paper from the strange device?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Quite the piece of work, isn't it?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You’ll need that paper.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>How can you weigh down the button?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>A rock would be great, but no such luck, even outside.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Not too many heavy things around. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>And most of the objects you can find here will just fall off.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>You need something round and reasonably dense.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Another apple.</details><br>

<b>What's my overall goal here?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Getting back to the living room is pretty easy - you can just drop the record.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Getting around the castle is pretty easy, once you have the doors open.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Finding all the items doesn't seem like the end, does it.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>So your goal must be something else.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You need to get rid of something, permanently. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>You'll know when to do this.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Shapes matter.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Once you complete the jigsaw puzzle, put the vinyl record in the resulting hole.</details><br>

<h3><b>Bienne</b></h3><br>

<b>Where is this? When?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Bienne.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Late enough to have the recognizably stale sky of postwar Europe.</details><br>

<b>What do I do at the altar?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Try setting it to different times.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Note what happens.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You just need to figure out the right time. See below.</details><br>

<b>I can't see the clock tower!</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You need to be in the Ring to get a good view. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Oh, you mean behind the dial? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You're not at the right angle.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Try from within the Zunfthaus.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>No luck?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Well, there's not many windows on the ground floor.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Try going up.</details><br>

<b>How do I get past the guard?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Bothering the guard is exactly the sort of foolhardy thing that tends to get Gromov killed.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Unfortunately, you are Gromov.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Who wants to live forever?</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Actually, you're safe so long as you don't attack the guard directly.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Does the guard take interest in anything besides you?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Maybe you can act casual.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Try doing some light reading.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Woops!</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Better hand it over - Not that you have much choice.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>Or do you?</details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>Try exiting the Zunfthaus with the portrait. </details><br>

<b>Help, the guard is chasing me!</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Of course he is! And you don't have a moment to spare, either.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Have you noticed anything dangerous around? Or a weapon you can use?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>If you have anything that might make for a decent weapon, try hitting the guard with it.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Ouch.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Anything a little less direct?</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Did you try looking in the fountain when you first saw it?</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Did you try getting the coin?</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Someone could break their neck in there!</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>If they had a good reason to go in.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>How could you coax the guard to risk his life in there?</details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>He only seems to care about one thing.</details>
<details><summary>12.</summary>Throw the portrait into the drain.</details>
<details><summary>13.</summary>Not quite...</details>
<details><summary>14.</summary>Give him a push.</details>
<details><summary>15.</summary>Now you can explore to your heart's content. </details>
<details><summary>16.</summary>It was him or you.</details><br>

<b>Is there anything important in all these books?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Besides finding the portrait?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Yes, actually.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>It's helpful for another puzzle.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>It's in the history book.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You'll need more information.</details><br>

<b>When does the train come?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Give it a few turns.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>HELLO CONDUCTOR?</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Never.</details><br>

<b>What am I doing at the train station?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Looking for something.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Okay, okay, you're looking for a clue.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>There's really only one thing here.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Take the poster.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Part of that timetable might look familiar.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Think outside the box a little.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>What numbers have you seen elsewhere?</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>If you're stuck, see the question about the books above.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Don't think hour:minute.</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>Think month:year.</details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>Something's important about Bern and Zurich.</details><br>

<b>What do I do with the machine in the Spielautomat? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You'll need items for the two slots. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>One's very thin - remind you of anything? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The coin can be found nearly in plain sight. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>It's in the fountain.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>For the star-shaped slot, see below.</details><br>

<b>What do I do with the machine in the Uhrenmuseum? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Note 'holding guests'.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You can put the figurines into the two recesses.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Note what happens when you do.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>See below.</details><br>

<b>Which figures do I need to use?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You've examined the train schedule, right?</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Something's important about Bern and Zurich.</details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You *could* solve this one with outside knowledge, but look around a little.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Examine all the scenes in the Uhrenmuseum.</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>One of the cities matches one of the figurines.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Bern doesn't have a match yet, though. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>You may be in Bienne...</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>But Bienne is in Bern. The canton, that is. </details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Where would a symbol like that be displayed? </details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>Check the clock tower again. </details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>You should put the bear in the left recess and the beast in the right.</details>
<details><summary>12.</summary>Interestingly enough, Bienne does have its own coat of arms - two axes.</details><br>

<b>What do I need this time for? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You've been looking for a time for something else.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>The altar in the Church. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Go set it to 20:10.</details><br>

<b>What do I do now? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Remember, you can get upstairs in the Zunfthaus now. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Go take a look. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>That wasn't there before. Get it. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Remember the machine in the Spielautomat? If not, go take another look. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>You've got items for both slots now. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Put them in. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>That empty bay looks useful. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>What do you have that might fit? </details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Put the watch in. </details><br>

<h3><b>Cambridge</b></h3><br>

<b>Am I in danger from the radiation? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Not unless you plan to spend the night. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Better get cracking. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>This space intentionally left blank.</details><br>

<b>How do I get around the catwalks? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>It can be tough to wrap one's head around the description of the tanks. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>There are four. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The catwalks are arranged in a hexagonal shape. You're at the bottom, and the catwalk with the door and lamp is at the top. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary> 
&nbsp;_<br>

\_/
</details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>The four tanks are at the o's above.</details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>You can get along the right-hand catwalk, northeast of the starting location.</details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>But the left-hand catwalk, to the northwest of your start, is inaccessible from the south end. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Your goal is to get to the bottom-left tank, then to turn the power on to get the door open. </details><br>

<b>How do I enter the filled tanks? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You can't. You'd be cooked. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>There are two buttons marked with waves. Each 'swaps' water between two adjacent tanks. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The button at the top catwalk will switch the top-left and top-right tanks. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>The button on the right-hand catwalk will switch the top-right and bottom-right tanks. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>The button on the left-hand catwalk only turns the power on and off. </details><br>

<b>How do I get the red card?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Not quite close enough, is it? </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Try looking around for something to move it with. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>You might have to look pretty hard. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>There's a broom amidst the knick-knacks in the storage room you start in. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>If you've managed to find something long and sturdy elsewhere, that'll work too. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Make sure the power is off! </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>You can tell by the description of the empty tanks.</details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>This space intentionally left blank.</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>Wood is basically non-conductive, so just pretend the broom has a metal handle.</details><br>

<b>Where'd the card go?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Well, it was in the bottom-left tank. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Remember, from your starting position, you couldn't go northwest? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Your starting position is actually right next to the southwest tank.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Circle back around to your starting point to find it. </details><br>

<b>How do I get in the door? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Make sure the power's on. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You'll need to use the switch in the top-right tank. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Then just put the red card in the slot at the door. </details><br>

<b>*Now* am I in danger from the radiation? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Yes, but you should be gone before you really need to worry. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You're getting about two CT scans per hour. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Not that the CT scan has been, or ever will be, invented in this timeline. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>To be precise - at 10,000 microsieverts per hour, you'd get a dose of 1 sievert in about four days. That dose conveniently corresponds to the amount required to cause symptoms of acute radiation syndrome. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Don't spend four days in here. Ideally, don't spend four minutes, if you can at all help it. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>The surface is much worse. </details><br>

<b>How do I get into the computer?  </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Look around, everything you need is nearby. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You need a password, of course. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Not much text near here. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>What do lazy people use as passwords? </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Maybe there's a clue on the Trinity box. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Maybe not. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Is there something given special emphasis in the log in the binder? </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Names are common passwords, aren't they? </details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>TYPE ALEXANDRIA</details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>Hmm, not quite. Close! </details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>On the contrary... </details>
<details><summary>12.</summary>TYPE AIRDNAXELA  </details><br>

<b>What am I looking for in the locker rooms? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>A closer look around will reveal two lockers that you can actually get into.</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Both the suit and the binder are helpful. </details><br>

<b>How do I get the door open? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>The messages aren't perfect, but they're telling you a great deal. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Not too shabby for 1947 computing. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Experiment a bit. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>The door won't open at first because the tunnel is flooded. You need to empty it. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Using VNT controls the wind tunnel vents. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Now the tunnel is holding a vacuum; the door won't open unless the pressure is equalized. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Using DIR controls the setting of the pump; using VNT while the pump is set to vacuum empties the tunnel, using it while the pump is on the other setting pressurizes it. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>From the starting position, TYPE VNT THEN TYPE DIR THEN TYPE VNT THEN TYPE DOR</details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>You'll know you've done it right when you get the ENERGY LOW message on entering a command. </details><br>

<b>I keep dying of radiation poisoning! </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You'd better check your equipment more carefully, Gromov. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Read the death message closely. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>The sleeve is the problem - now you just need something to fix it. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Rubber cement would be great, but there's none at hand. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>The note attached to the suit - notice anything about it? </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Take the tape, then PUT TAPE ON SLEEVE. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>This improvised fix will work for just long enough. </details><br>

<b>What do I do on the surface? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Enjoy the view? </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>See if you can spot the Great Dome. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>This isn't The Lurking Horror! Get your mission done. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>It's grisly, but needs must - there's something underneath your comrade here. </details>

<details><summary>1.</summary>You're telling me. Just listen, you'll learn more. </details><br>

<b>What do I do? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You'll know when the moment comes. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>The mysterious device is the key to all this, right? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Touching it will send you... somewhere else. </details>

<b>How do I distract the guard?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Give him something else to worry about. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Got anything that makes noise? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Think back to the alleyway. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Search the crates. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Throw the disc - whichever direction you please, it won't matter. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>There's your opening. </details><br>

<b>What am I doing in here? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>What else was stopping you outside? </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>You couldn't move around safely in the open. Someone might see. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>How can you fix that? </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Did you check your inventory while holding the metal disc? </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>This is a sneaking mission. The use of stealth is required. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Look in the cockpit. </details><br>

<b>How do I get the uniform? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Normally, you should be able to retract the canopy hood or open the pilot's door. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Unfortunately, it seems like the mechanism is stuck. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Look around. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>There are certain simple machines that can help apply force in a more effective way. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>One of them can be readily improvised with something you find in the hangar. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Check the bags. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Get the pipe. </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>The language can be fiddly - you want to PUT PIPE IN GAP or IN HOOD and then PULL PIPE. </details><br>

<b>I still die when I approach the plane on the runway. </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>Yes, because the plane takes off before you're ready. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>What's the usual reason flights get cancelled? </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Even in England, there are limits to the weather pilots want to deal with.</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>You're not about to make the weather worse. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>But you can tell someone it's worse than it is. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Where would you normally talk to a plane from? </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Get in the control tower. </details><br>

<b>What's my goal in the control tower?</b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You need to delay the flight, any way you can. </details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>Read the logbook thoroughly. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Check out the radio gear. </details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Looks like someone's gone and made your job much harder. </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>But the keyboard setup is still working. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>You need to find the right signal. </details>
<details><summary>7.</summary>Logbook not making sense? </details>
<details><summary>8.</summary>Admittedly, this one is the kind of puzzle that's very hard to give good hints for. </details>
<details><summary>9.</summary>All of the codes mentioned in the logbook are part of an RAF phonetic alphabet, used to increase clarity in voice communications. </details>
<details><summary>10.</summary>It's the same basic principle as the modern NATO phonetic alphabet - Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc. </details>
<details><summary>11.</summary>Just more British. </details>
<details><summary>12.</summary>There's a line about poor weather, but the code is redacted. </details>
<details><summary>13.</summary>Not a very helpful codebook if the people who need it can't read it, but what can you do. </details>
<details><summary>14.</summary>You've seen a halfway similar letter code earlier - in Aberdeen. </details>
<details><summary>15.</summary>What did that line of the song mean there? </details>
<details><summary>16.</summary>TYPE F. </details>
<details><summary>17.</summary>No luck - you need the corresponding word from the phonetic alphabet. </details>
<details><summary>18.</summary>The last entry of the logbook goes through the alphabet in order, at least the first seven letters. </details>
<details><summary>19.</summary>TYPE FREDDIE</details><br>

<b>How do I defuse the bomb? </b><br>
<details><summary>1.</summary>You might have found something helpful in the lab...</details>
<details><summary>2.</summary>But if you did, you're playing a different game. </details>
<details><summary>3.</summary>Take a look at the "strange orange object".</details>
<details><summary>4.</summary>Dirty keys... </details>
<details><summary>5.</summary>Probably the keys which have been used recently. </details>
<details><summary>6.</summary>Probably the keys used to set the code to the bomb. </details>

<details><summary>1.</summary>Enjoy the ride. </details><br>
